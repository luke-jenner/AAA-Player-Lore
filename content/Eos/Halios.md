A bastion of civilization in the Ethereal Plane. A living relic of the ingenuity of the Archons from the First Age - abandoned and lost for ages after The Fall, Halios has been resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by remnants of the First Age. Serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life. 

A miracle of architecture - a floating city carved out of a single, massive divine fossil known as **The Eternal Comet** that snakes around colossal gemstones. (Divine Fossil is a Gaia Seed, stripped from Archon that incited the Fall of Flying Civilizations pre Godswar). 
	**The Eternal Comet** is pure Etherstone, for millenia has been leaving a trail of scattered meteorites across the weave<br> 
	Changes color for unknown reasons. Sometimes it holds a color for an entire year, while other times it shifts twice in a single week. <br> 
	***If anyone tries to take any ethereal stone** from the comet - comet begins fighting back. “You must not pluck it like some juvenile ripping leaves off of trees. You must only reap what you have learned to sew, lest it not belong to you. While many ethereal ores fall off and begin their cycle, the raw power of the ore here has a consciousness - it knows.*

**Halios is currently protected by a mass Globe of Invlunerability, placed by the Voices of the Ancients** - damaging spells of 5th level and lower have no effect. 
	[[Battles on the Ethereal Plane]] and [[Chaosether is Spreading]] are currently large threats to Halios, though it has frozen itself into a spellbind in the past to avoid threats 

An extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty - Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in Halios. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid. 

Lead Factions:
- **Voices of the Ancients** - leaders of Halios, descendents of Archon that never left Halios - hire freelancers to asess threats to Halios
- [[Horizon Guard]] - seek information so they can identify crisis points across the planes
	Agents on the Material Plane are typically the Vaati [[Jhimbo & Copy]]

"The Cobalt Archon" - one of the founders of Halios from the ancient city of Archon. Known for that as he befriended a Cobalt Dragon that he traveled the planes with, assembling a mass of knowledge and treasure. 
	Name has since been lost.
	Known for philanthropy and protection - knowledge could build and protect us from chaos of the worlds. 
	Started the "Cobalt Reserve" in the city of Archon itself, though was lost during the Fall of Flying Cities 
	The "Cobalt Soul" in Willow and Ellesion connect their heritage to the Cobalt Archon, valuing the pursuit of knowledge as a force of protection in the realms. They, however, made it religious following the Godswar, attributing reverence to Ioun after her work in defeating the Betrayer Gods.
### Court of Whispers

Denizens of Court of Whispers barter for current knowledge. Heralds, criers, bards, and griots buy and sell information from the fifteen founding civilizations active in Halios, as well as other lands. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term recon and long-term infiltration. Mixed indoor-outdoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas. 

**Voices of the Ancients** - the leaders of Halios - employ freelancers from the Court of whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people’s homelands, as well as potential threats to Halios, while the Horizon Guard seek information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. 

Frequented by [[Planar Ambassadors]], used as a waystation like Sigil.

### House of Convalescence

Focuses the life-giving energies of the **Eternal Comet**, allowing for its incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It draws clerics and healers of many traditions, most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of hte place itself. <br>
	Exterior adorned with marble columns, intricately carved celestial motifs ascending them. Structure is surrounded by small, luminescent gardens that almost grow into the building via several porches.
	Walking up steps, you arrive ata grand entrance, framed by colossal statues of mages - clerics from another age - their hands raised in gestures of both healing and magical invocation. The entryway is flanked by braziers that emit a gentle, flickering blue-green flame. <br>
	Healing Gardens in the house provide refuge for those seeking physical and spiritual recovery - many benches and reclined seating are placed through gardens. (Celstial flowers, herbs, tended b magi-clerics)<br>
	Chambers of Tranquil Divination - provide spiritual guidance into ethereal forces that shape the destinies of Halios' inhabitants.<br>
	Dormitories - places of temporary abode for those healing during their stay. <br>

### Palace of Exile

First Age civilizations, escaping to the Ethereal Plane to flee from the Fall of Falling Cities, built the Palace of Exile as a place that would always help those in need. Predominantly populated during the Godswar over 2,000 years ago, the palace has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in Halios permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palaces’ staff coordinate with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded. 

[[Horizon Guard]], Halios’ dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. 

Set higher that most buildings on the comet, Palace of Exile is built on a natural occuring rise in the comet's surface, with steep walls that need a walkway to ascend. The pathway is paved from an older style than most of the streets, they're carved from the comet itself and glow with your footsteps. 

The exterior facades are adorned with masonry that glows from absorbing the light of the comet on which are murals of constellations (not constellations of Eos, but of other planes - guide travelers to the heart of the comet, representing inerconnectedness of the cosmological wheel)

### Preserve of the Cobalt Archon

A sprawling, domed wilderness cut into the heart of the Eternal Comet. Lush vegetation grows directly out of the stone. In the center of the Preserve is a circular, in-ground amphitheater that serves as a meeting place for the Voices of the Ancestors. 
	Massive, wilderness of a graden - full of colors and scents, filled with all kinds of bioluminescent flora. Enchanted vines weave through te air, forming natural archways that lead visitors to various sections of the garden.

A sect of druids frequently brings injured animals here to be healed and rehabilitated. The Preserve is where the druids keep animals that can no longer survive in their natural habitats. Spirits from countless lands make their home in the Preserve.

### Trade Discal

Encircling the Eternal Comet, Trade Discal is a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. IT serves the needs of cities and nations or major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported via the Cobalt Jewels to the Trad Discal quickly and safely. 

### Cobalt Jewels

Connect Halios to its founding civilizations. Ethereal teleportation. Requires a DC14 Arcana to use for Plane Shifting 

A raised discal, almost primal in its stonehenge-like consruction, though rather than a full circle it is half of a widened oval. Ancient, marble pillars that create arches along the arc almost look like gateways, fittingly underneath each are several crystals. 
	Material Plane, general locations

### A Liminal City

After built by the Archons, they were met by the arrival of other sentient species exploring the Ethereal Plane, seemingly from other worlds and planes. The Eternal Comet acts like a beacon for the lost and hopeless in the Deep Ethereal - many can find it within just days of searching.

### Starlight Sanctuaries 

Perched atop the highest spires of Halios, the Starlight Sanctuaries are majestic structures that serve as both centers of cosmic study and sanctuaries of celestial wisdom. Observatories are dedicated to the unraveling ofo the mysteries of the multiverse, the tracking of celestial phenomena, and the interpretation of the cosmic tapestry that weaves through the Ethereal Plane. 

Crafted from ethereal rsytal of the comet, each observatory is an intricate fusion of art and magic, adorned with celestial engravings, luminescent glyphs, and floating starlight orbs. They stand tall, reaching toward the ethereal expanse, their crstyalline spires reflecting the ever-changing hues of the comet's tail. 

Powerful ethereal telescopes, crafted from crystallized starlight. Adorned with silver filigrees and embedded with sapphires that refract and enhance the light of distant stars. Seers and astronomers utilize these telescopes to peer into the far reaches of the Ethereal Plane and beyond. 

Dedicated order of scholars known as Starbinders reside here - celestial intellectuals chosen for their innate connection to the Ethereal Plane. 


### Starwarden Harbor
 floating island adorned with cascading ethereal waterfalls and surrounded by floating gardens, the harbor is illuminated by the celestial tale of the comet, containing floating platforms and luminescent runways, currently around two dozen other docked skyships - or starships. (Myriad of diverse ships - some look ancient elven in make, others far from recognizable - some entirely of crystal, one of wispy fire.

Flashing motes of brunestone, as if creating a runway for the Moonspear, align themselves to form a path between the ship and the harbor.

Glistening mooring towers resonating with very visible, abjuration protection enchantments flag your passing into the harbor, before astral ropes dance out to secure the Moonspear.**

### The Sojurn
Near the Starwarden Harbor, an inn adorned with luminescent runes and overgrowing glowing ivy (luminara ivy), looks pleasantly wholesome as opposed to the otherwise gaudiness and ancient nature of the city's architecture.

Common Room - celestial chandelier that flickers with arcane fire lights, adorned with tables, sofas, and a currently unoccupied stage. 

Ethereal Brews - elixirs & spirits from across the planes 
	Astral Ambrosia - Starlight nectar from sigil, Luminara Gin from Halios

### NPCs
#### Akiyoshi - Starwarden, The Wanderer's Oracle
Blue -purple furred kitsune, silver tufts
- Will speak in Celestial until he recognizes travellers from the Material Plane and switch to Common
- Eyes a celestial shade of blue, draped in flowing robes of astral silk that are adorned with luminescent symbols, radiating with some form of magic. 
- Serves as a spiritual guide and celestial advisor for travelers coming into Halios - often times is just blessing departing skyships or conducting astrological ceremonies for travelers 
- Was taken in by the Palace of Exile a long time ago, found meaning in working to help guide others, letting Halios be a place of transience in life 
- Referred to as the “Wanderer’s Oracle” - uncanny ability to offer guidances that resonates with travelers passing through 
- Commands Ethereal Winds, along with Abjuration Runes in the harbor
- Will guide AAA to Palace of Exile or House of Convalescence if they need healing 
- Can take to the Cobalt Jewels to send home immediately if that’s what they’d like
- Noting Bron: Oh! Are you not from here? And here I thought I was welcoming you home. (You’re an Etherborn - you were born on the Ethereal Plane. Far from common, compared to those that come from other planes and worlds to Halios. But of indigenous birth.)

#### Rowan - Firbolg Horizon Guard, Palace of Exile
(Ryan Lammers)
imposing height of 6'8" firbolg, long, wavy white hair that drops down below their waistline almost like a cape, pink-beige skin that is mostly hidden by a deep navy coat of fur and what looks like enchanted armor crafted from interwoven leaves of plate, etched with arcane symbols. Beneath the armor sits a waist cape of deep violets with silver lining, like an extension of their hair. Carries two sheathed weapons. 
	We do not freely distribute the threshold to Halios - one must arrive here through their own volition, or with the guidance of one that came before. <br> 
	(Halios does not seek to be a lighthouse or a leader of the planes, but rather a space of transience between them and a home to those that protect them. This location must be kept in reverence.)
	(Only intervene when the need is great and when the balance of the planes is at stake. (Vaati aided fight against Tiamat in Crisis of Dragons.))<br> 
	Knows of Chaosether - a large source of the Horizon Guard’s current enemies, a danger that is creating a malevolence across the Ethereal Plane. A wild, chaotic affliction of ether - too unpredictable, and too misunderstood to begin to contain.<br>  
	Familiar of factions rising from Ethereal Plane (VFD) though is unwilling to disclose information. Will take information and pass on to the Horizon Guard to assess. 
	((**HORIZON GUARD MAY TAKE INTEREST - SEEK ALLIES TO INVESTIGATE VFD & AWAKENING POWERS/SPREADING CHAOSETHER))<br> 
	End of advice for Bron: You need to stay safe. Stay around people you trust, and who trust you. These are tense times - balances of power are shifting, factions long-dormant are now rising warring with one another. Ancient powers, new mysteries. The future has never been less certain. <br> 
	Your separation is a split in the weave, a fracture that can be immensely powerful. Though you’re a power that will be sought after - to either use and excite, or to extinguish. You’re safe here, on Halios, though that may only be temporary. Do not let others use your power without your consent - you are your own master, make what you will with it.**

#### Jocen - Satyr Barkeep at the Sojurn, Poet and Artist
(Josh Blum)

Satyr - coat of black fur that shimmers in the astral light of Halios, complimented by pale skin - expressive, hazel eyes beneath a very asymmetrical haircut - buzzed sides, lopsided hanging bangs with what would be a mullet currently tied back into a messy bun

Dressed in a very baggy, black tunic with small white symbols embroidered into it - strapped to his back is a handcrafted lyre.

Multi-talented artist, excels in celestial landscapes, improvised music, and poetry. 

Regularly hosts poetry readings & storytelling as entertainment at the **Sojurn**. Currently bartending there as an in-between job, figuring out what comes next. 

Often sought after for ethereal commissions, enchantements, and Dreamweaver Murals - depict scenes from an indvidiual's dreams. 

Stardust sculptures, collected from ethereal winds of the Eternal Comet - very ephemeral 

Organizes "moonlit soirees" - fusion of art, music, and dance for visitors of the ethereal plane

#### Elara Saranae - Elven Twilight Cleric, House of Convalescence
(J. Fenske)
Shoulder length silver hair with deep red layers, sharp eyes and facial features with an empathetic gaze - flowing robes of predominantly crimson, luminescent thread, a circlet on her head with a seven-pointed star

- Basic healing powers
- Empathetic counsel - currently facing difficult times, many feel as though lines of war and the fates are being drawn 
- Celestial infusions - brews potions & elixirs with ethereal energies - her healing potions don't just heal but offer clarity (advantage on rolls or Bless Spell)
- Leads astromancy rituals of moonlight, creates the atmosphere of tranquility - protect the House from energies of strife 
- Blessing of the Twilight Guardian - significant blessing that shields individuals from ethereal disturbances 
- **IF TRUST IS WON**, can provide a Gate Coin, like the one [[Tevos]] had

To Bron: ** Wish I could offer words as strong as the magic you're made of, or insight as to what cosmological forces brought you to the way you are. Times are uncertain. The Ethereal Plane is becoming a place of danger once again. 
	The last Etherborn that came through here to learn exactly what they were did join the Horizon Guard, albeit a bit hesitant of a member. They also had a group of friends they journeyed with, now intent on solving mysteries in the realm. ([[Tevos]]) He seemed like he'd always known, though that feeling never tends to feel like resolve.

There are a pair of Etherborn that reside here, in the Starlight Sanctuaries - one has been here for a very, very long time. The other is their apprentice. 

Elara is originally from Velde Aerdrie, though in her youth had an affinity for stars and their ethereal energies - had visions in her astronomical studies of what she learned was the Eternal Comet. Went on a pilgrmage for nearly a century before crossing paths wit hthe right person that noticed her writings and symbolism that matched the Eternal Comet, and was given a portal to the ethereal plane. House of Convalescence recognized me as a guardian of twilight, something held sacred by the Horizon Guard. Have been here since, occasionally returning home to visit loved ones. 

#### Wylydia  and Meywen - Master & Apprentice, Starlight Sanctuaries
(Wendy and Melusine)

Both are Etherborn - their appearance, while regular in their shape & silhouette, seems to waiver in the light - in the shadows, their form take the astral cosmos of Bron - filling with constellations and dark nebulae. Though in the light, you see their forms.

Wylydia (vil-id-ee-uh)- a human woman, older, seeming to be in her mid-50s based on the creases in her round but stern face - dark brown hair that comes to a point below her shoulder-blades, skin that seems to glow, and most strikingly white-gold eyes that don't have pupils.
	She wears comfortable though fit clothes - not quite the flowing robes of many other residents of the Eternal Comet, potentially that of a traveler on the Material Plane with a bit of fashion sense. If anything denotes her rank as a venerable astronomer, its an otherworldly staff she carries - crowned with a crystal that shifts in hue like the tail of the comet .
	<br> 
	Demanding, but rewarding. Encourages students to embrace precision, instilling a deep appreciation for the interconnected dance of the stars. Judgements are tempered with constructive criticsim. 
	Lectures cover planar navigation to celestial omens. 
	<br> 
	Member of the Voices of the Ancients. An ancient descendent of Archon, acutely disinterested in having a hand in the change of power, though highly encouraging and critical of it. Aware of VFD, sees them as hopelessly reckless. Will not name them - will not equip anyone that seeks to fight or defend them. 

**Meywen** - half-elven, likely somewhere between 20 and 35 - indictative of the blend between elven grace and human vigor. Blonde & auburn hair trimmed short, silver eyes. Wears a combo of ethereal fabrics with practical adventuring gear. Carries a satchel of celestial scrolls and a compass that points to the Eternal Comet. 
	Spirited and inquisitve. Apprentice astronomer, assists in maintaining the observatory, records of observations, and aids in organizing lctures. Responsible for coumenting movements of celestial bodies.
	<br> 
	Originally from Ethelia, though a non-royal family that moved to Mythfaer after the Breaking of Willow. Made friends with The Map House, who introduced her to Wylydia. A small lesson turned into a pestering curiosity, which blossomed into an apprenticeship. 
	<br> 
	Has dreams of making her own celestial maps, contributing to the lore of the Eternal Comet and beyond. Her sketches and notes capture ephemeral beauty of astral phenomena, aspires to have a celestial legacy that inspires the future. 
	<br> 
	In her free time, is a risk-taking planar explorer. Delves into planar groves, encountering creatures foretold by constellation prophecies.

#### Ecken- Dwarven Gardener in the Cobalt Preserve 

(Esch) 

Stout dwarf, locks of emeral green casting down the back of their head with a short, shaped up trim in front. Their skin is weathered, though young - deep gray eyes. They're wearing earth-toned clothing that is adorned with a hefty double-belt strapped with gardening tools.
	Born into a family that tended the Mithril Halls of Dar'Rag, didn't quite have a place as their older brothers and sisters already held those so Ecken traveled. Eventually met a traveling astronomer in Willow that talked of an ethereal comet, where the natural and the magical converged. Ecken journaled of it and spoke to the plants in their journeys of it. One fateful day, in a sacred grove deep in the Mrost Realm (Star Mounts), a shimmering portal manifested to a celestial doorway - it was their calling to come to the Eternal Comet. 
	Upon their crossing, Ecken eventualy made kinship and was reconigzed for a unique connection to the natural world. Preserve of the Cobalt Archon took them in with open arms.<br>
	Now responsible for cultivating ethereal flora that graces the comet's gardens. Pulls many fruits and foods that are consumed by the folk of the comet, including:
	- Stardust Blossoms - ethereal spectrum flowers, often used by the House of Convalescence
	- Luminara Vines - produce radiant frutis that emit a gentle glow, rich in rejuvenating juice
	- Aetherial Grains - Staple food source
	- Astral Root Vegetables
	- Ephemeral Orchids
