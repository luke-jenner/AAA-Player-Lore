A Flying City over [[Ellesion]], Rivaled by  [[Netharis]] over Northern Kawluurac and Willo over the Heartlands

-Most likely rose from what is currently Tafos Lake in the Folos Forest

Archons - Mortals that ascended through manipulation of the weave, became tyrants of power, lawfully shepherding mortal races to empower themselves in the weave and leading to the first flying cities. Began to reject the gods and in their expansion, discovered the Ethereal Plane. 

Archons set out on an Ethereal Conquest, building cities in the Ethereal Plane such  as [[Halios]] while keeping their discovery a secret from the rival flying cities ([[Netharis]]). Eventually, the ambition of the Archons stirred betrayals & spilt secrets as the gates to the Ethereal Plane were open. Not before long, Chaos Seals were discovered and Archons ventured into Chaos, finding these Seals around the Prime Material Plane. Many Archons sought to master the Chaosether, and many disappeared, factoring into the Fall of the Flying Cities. 

An elite order of Archons sought to bring Law & Light to Chaos - using "Fires of Amaunator" to forge blades of the sun ([[Dawnbringer]])
	These archons fought the chaosether past the seals
	Didn't have sacred knowledge of [[Harmonia]] hidden  by the gods

Ddi they fall because they drew the ire of the gods? 

Archons persisted past the Godswar, though they became quiet, lesser beings. Many went into hiding. Solyssia of Altrinios descends from a line of Archons. Some formed [[VFD]].

# The Archons
- First-age civilization that was always trying to ascend
- Placed power and belief in 'gnosis' and the acquiescence of knowledge over reverence for the divine
- Had always resented the gods, in a time when few did - largely seen as the probelmatic anarchists of the First Age 
- Believed the world was strife and pain - material nature of things was not the purest of life, and that there was better 
	- The Gods had access to it - why shouldn't everyone?
- Driven by research of transcendence, learned about the nature of the weave in unparalleled ways 
	- Used learned magic to enrich their societies and daily life
	- Were likely the first of the flying cities to ascend, before Willo, [[Netharis]], Veskos, & [[Amphrithios]]... shortly followed by their rivals, Willo & [[Netharis]]
- An ancient [[Apocrypha]] of the Archons wrote that we are ethereal beings - [[Etherborn]] forced into the mortal & material world
