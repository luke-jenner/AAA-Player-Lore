### Lore

-Supposed to be in the background - like a backstage - it’s nowhere, it’s in-between everything 
-No one is SUPPOSED to go there

“Terms and concepts like space, distance, time, movement, body, and even plane itself are relative. They exist only as perceptions, not as reality. 

>"Take two thin stick and spread them about a foot apart. Then, move them within 6 inches of each other. Then half the distance of that. And then again. And then again. Until they almost touch. Then imagine half the space that separates the sticks. Again. And again. Imagine the space until it gets infinitely tiny.
The sticks will never actually touch, because they only cross half the distance - so on into infinity."

Between everything there is a space - sometimes a space that can only be imagined. 

The astral sea is not a place - it’s not a space at all - it’s a realm of the mind. It’s all a matter of perspective. 

"**The mind sees distance. Feels space around it, and perceives what it thinks is a plane. No matter where a body goes - they’re on a plane, right? Wrong. A person can leave the planes.** "

It’s not space travel because you’re in the void between space. 

Many have now used it as a means to get from one plane to another. 

If these planes - these worlds that we exist in - were created at some point, and they’re separate, then it’s safe to say no one was MEANT to go to the Astral Sea. The first mortal pioneers of the Astral Sea must have wound up there by arcane incident.   

It’s the backstage area that no one was ever meant to see. 

Dead gods, floating in the void. Historically, this is where the Dawn War took place. 

Creatures don’t age or suffer from hunger or thirst. 

((TRUE SIGHT ON THE ASTRAL STUNS YOU FOR DURATION OF THE SPELL - SHOWS YOU ULTIMATE INFINITY OF THE PLANE))

[[Steve]]: TIME DOES PASS ON THE ASTRAL PLANE, BUT INCREDIBLY SLOWLY. 365,000 to one. Or, 1,000 years on the Astral Plane is a single day here on the Prime Material. 

-Natural healing is useless - your wounds won’t close over time - can only heal through magic
-Resting doesn’t do anything - no spell recovery - but you still need to sleep for your mind
-Potions that have a time duration could last forever (170 days = 6 seconds)
-Potions become viscous (like ketchup) and get stuck to sides of vials - use wine skins instead

Time does catch up to you - as soon as you leave, every day you spend will be given right back. Diseases could catch up. Hunger catches up. 

**You need a conduit - a permanent link between worlds of mortals and worlds of the gods - a constructed connection that are formed to allow these existences to be together.** 

It’s how gods send spells past the Divine Gate. It’s how you pass to the Feywild or the Shadowfell. They’re typically invisible, most have some kind of a lifespan. Usually if it forms naturally, the conduit will swallow a moment of the plane it cracks to life on. Takes it with it. 

Those conduits are the only natural thing in the Astral Sea. These voids, light holes. 

The SAFEST way to travel there is through Astral Projection - just sending your consciousness there rather than your entire corporeal self. Attached via a mental cord. But, you cannot bring anything back with you.

Levi has detailed charts of the Astral Sea, navigation lines, and runes that move across each chart. Stolen long ago from a githyanki vessel. At one point had a magic spell attached that alerted its previous owners and they were attacked, followed them to githyanki shipyards where they were preparing an invasion of the Far Realm via a Codex of Infinite Planes, long story. 

Psychisch Wind - a storm of thought that battles travelers minds - made up of lost memories, FORGOTTEN IDEAS, minor musings, subconscious fears. First sensed as rapid darkening.
	DC15 intelligence saving throw - save suffers Location Effect, fail suffers both Location & Mental (DMG 48)

Encounters: Planar travelers, refugees from other planes
	-Githyanki raid travelers often - their city is a floating body of a dead god
	-Angels, demons, devils, night hags, yugoloths, or other travelers

### Further Ideas

Exalted of Bane (conquest), Gruumsh (destruction), and Kord are about 
	Nine Hells - Asmodeus eneginnered murder of his patron deity and ascended from the ignominy of eternal punishment to immortal power as a major god - fashioned Nine Hells as a torture engine for the creation of magical energy - took advantage of the Dawn War and grew stronger 

Githyanki, enslaved by illithids long ago, were trained for war - now are sailing radiers and pirates, preying on border islands and those sailing between islands - hail from wandering city Tu’narath

Will go full military mode, leaving no survivors, if tried to be pled for mercy or economic self interest 
  
Quom - once a peaceful, healing people - converted to violence after the accidental destruction of their god/domain (LAKAL) during the Dawn War during ab attle between Bahamut and a primordial - use fragments of the body of their dead god as power
### Conduit to [[Cosmological Wheel]]

### The Plane Above

Infinite silver expanse - dotted by countless small shards of land, scattered larger islands, and the dominions of gods.
  
History: Gods had grand plans for a single realm that would link their dominions together: the Lattice of Heaven
During Dawnwar - gods intervening to prevent primordials from destroying creation - primordials responded by invading the Plane Above. Gods died, dominions crumbled, and the Lattice was shattered. 

Only a few of the divine domains survived

Shattered dominions, ruins, corpses of forgotten gods and primordials, and war magic left over from the Dawn War still linger within the Astral Sea

Echoes of the Dawn WAr are poised to enter the astral sea… 

### Sailing

Astral Horizon: forms something like the surface of an ocean

Mists below are darker and denser, mists above are brighter and more open

Most creatures and vessels slowly orient themselves toward the subtle demarcation, often without realizing it

Moving higher or lower tends to have negative effects on travel - psychologically more difficult, feels like being underwater 

It’s also where the conduits and channels coalesce 

Astral winds are more reliable than oceans

Islands - Countless motes, tumbling wrecks of Dawn War battlefields, citadel islands 

Only fixed locations are occupied by divine dominions that maintain some form of the Lattice - Celestia, Tytherion, the Nine Hells 

Rest of islands often change position slightly or drastically as changes in the astral tide 

Navigators start with basic directions from one domain to the next - time it takes to sail or fly through varies hugely depending on flow of astral energy that is largely imperceptible 

More of an archipelago

Channels - color strands - wide ribbons of light that rapidly takes a traveler to the related divine dominion - faster to travel if you know what you’re doing, dangerous if you’re avoiding the exalted consequences of the gods 

**Sigil** - City of Doors - occupies the inner surfaces of a toroidal structure floating - countless gates and portals to earthly realms and extraplanar realities riddle its byzantine streets - serve as way stations for travelers and miscreants 
	Residence not for the fainthearted - city is anarchic and inhabited by some of the most dangerous beings in existence
	Polygot Market WArd - where Levi made off with astral charts from bedding with a goddess 

Astral Sea is a scene of perpetual age of exploration - fragments of ancient battlefield have escaped plunder since the Dawn War - some full of rich magic items from the original armies of the gods. 
  
**Astral Dreadnaughts** - allegedly created by Tharizdun to hunt mortals and prevent them from entering the upper planes**
