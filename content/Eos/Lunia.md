### Laws in Lunia
- Weapons should only be raised
	- In self-defense
	- In defense of another

"Trust is everywhere."

Because "anyone can atone" - evil sophonts do make their way into Lunia with plots

Religous laws are non-restricting

	Churches of good gods are quite common - largest are in Light's Hold: Lathander, Ilmater, Sune, and Helm
	Sects of all good gods can be found in Lunia
### Combat Encounters
- Demonic Invasion
	- A Nalfeshnee, accompanied by 10 Vrocks and a swarm of 30 Quasits breaches a gateway into the plane and begins to rampage. The party gains the help of the Stormborne (celestial Storm Giants) in defense of a settlement.
- Fallen Angel
	- Whispers of a demon have finally corrupted an angel of the plane, forcing him/her into a violent frenzy. The party faces a fallen Deva who is rampaging through the wild destroying all in its path.
- Elemental Assault
	-  The Cult of Elemental Air has successfully bridged the gap between the plane of Air and Mount Celestia and is pouring an evil invasion force through the gap, assaulting Lunia from the sky with air elementals and a cultist airship. The party must help protect innocents from the assault of 10 Air Elementals, 20 cultists, 4 cult fanatics, and a Djinni.
- Githyanki Raiders
	- Githyanki Raiders pour through a rupture in the fabric of the plane, emerging from the Astral in the center of a settlement and plunder vigorously. The party must defend against 30 Githyanki Warriors, 10 Githyanki Knights, 3 young Red Dragons and 1 adult Red Dragon.

### Non-Combat Encounters
- 1. The party comes upon an old man regaling children in the tale of the first trial of Mount Celestia’s infamous stairs.
- 2) A member of the Hand of Torm senses that one (or all) of the party members is not Lawful/Good enough to be on the plane and confronts them.
- 3) The party discovers that a local priest is acting strange. He is really a doppelganger garnering information about the cities defenses and relaying them to the Elemental Cult of Air.
- 4) The party discovers the mangled body of a creature and must investigate what creature could have done this on the very planar embodiment of good. (Possible culprits include: Corrupted angel or aasimar, Githyanki raiders who are hiding among the masses, succubi or other demons taking on the forms of celestials.)
- - Two aasimar climbers are having trouble, though the path appears clear to the PCs. One thinks the other is holding him back. The other says the first insisted on bringing all their junk, and that's what's holding them back. Both refuse to listen to each other, but might listen to PCs.
- A lantern archon is headed the wrong way. It stops to ask the players which way is up, and can't really tell which way the players are pointing, and if questioned, tries its hardest to give the "right" answers, but they're not actually helpful.
- In Heart's Faith, a central hub town that trades goods delivered from upper layers to travelers in other planes who can only make it so far, a begger stops the players to ask for some money for climbing gear and food. She clearly tries to get the most out of the players that she can.
- A lantern archon is admonishing all climbers who pass, and being very harsh and self-righteous. A tiefling is getting angry at the chastisement, even though it's trying its hardest. It looks like it might give up, or outright attack the lantern archon if it goes on any further.

### NPCs
Xarritrix, Guardian of the Sea
	Xarritrix is an Ancient Bronze Dragon who often takes the form of small creatures to entertain children. She can often be found in coastal settlements, enjoying her time off from protecting the Silver Sea by amusing the common celestial folk. She has a very clear, high voice and uses slang that she picks up from the children and young humanoids she often converses with in Elven form (i.e. talks much less formally than your average dragon).

Aezor Greenhoof
	Aezor is a centaur ranger who can be found ranging the woods near Hearthtown. His horse form is a chestnut brown, and his pale white human skin is made whiter by the perpetual moonlight of Lunia. He is extremely friendly, and prioritizes personal freedoms above all else. He is a social liberal who finds no peculiarity any less than marvelous unless it infringes on his, or others, own interests.

Comodo White-eyes
	Comodo is an aasimar monk who travels the expanse of the Silver Sea on a fairly rudimentary and humble rowboat. He is a sage at heart and finds eternal joy in seeking knowledge from the countless inhabitants of Lunia. He is always adding new things to his magical journal, that holds endless pages and serves as an alternative, permanent memory bank for all of his thoughts, stories, and ideas. He always has a wide smile on his face, and his eyes glow white (tinge of angelic heritage).

Motherai
	This tiefling was tainted by the devil-blood of Asmodeus and was born into a cruel underworld of thievery, murder, and darker things. Raised among miscreants and evildoers in the slums of Mrosthad, Mortherai sought a better future for himself. After a life-altering experience in which a Priest of Lathander saved his life from disease, he left his home to seek enlightenment and atonement for the sins of his early past. He travelled far and wide across Eos, rooting out evil and protecting the innocent in any way he could. His prowess as a rogue let him spy on criminals and wrongdoers, and he dealt out swift and lethal punishment to those he saw as a threat to the good of the world. His travels led him to a gateway that led to the Astral Plane, and he pursued the realm of Mount Celestia in hopes of proving his worth and righteousness by climbing its eternal peaks. Mortherai may have just arrived when your party reaches the plane, allowing them to follow his storyline as he seeks redemption in the trials of the mountain. Otherwise, he could already be a stable member of Lunia’s society.

Seraphina, Elven Bard
	Seraphina is a celestial elf bard known for her mesmerizing performances under the perpetual moonlight of Lunia. Her silver hair flows like liquid light, and her eyes reflect the constellations. She plays a harp crafted from stardust and dragonbone, and her songs are said to soothe even the most troubled souls. Seraphina often travels from settlement to settlement, sharing her music and stories with all who will listen. She is kind-hearted and always willing to lend an ear or offer counsel.

Thalindra, Guardian of Moonlit Forest
	Thalindra is a guardian angel who oversees the safety of travelers in the Moonlit Forest of Lunia. She appears as a tall, statuesque figure with golden skin and radiant wings that shimmer like the night sky. Thalindra wields a spear of pure light and can summon celestial creatures to aid her in protecting the innocent. She is stoic and duty-bound, yet compassionate to those she guards.

Lysara, Celestial Sorceress
	Lysara is a celestial sorceress who resides in a tower made of moonstone and crystal. She is known for her ability to weave starlight into powerful enchantments and spells. Lysara has deep blue skin and eyes that glow with an inner light. She is a recluse, but those who seek her out for magical aid or knowledge find her to be wise and generous. Lysara often helps guide lost souls and adventurers who find themselves in Lunia.

Galadriel, pegasus knight
	Galadriel is a pegasus knight who patrols the skies of Lunia, ensuring peace and order from above. She is a fierce warrior with flowing silver hair and a suit of enchanted armor that glows softly in the moonlight. Her mount, a majestic pegasus named Stormwing, is equally formidable. Galadriel is honorable and courageous, always ready to defend the weak and uphold justice.

Arion Starwatcher
	Arion is a wise old gnome astronomer who spends his days and nights observing the stars from his observatory on a hill. He has a long white beard and wears spectacles that enhance his already keen vision. Arion has charted the stars and celestial events of Lunia for centuries and is a treasure trove of knowledge about the heavens.
