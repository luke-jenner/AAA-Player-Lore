[[Willow (Continent)]] [[Willow]]

Willow History
	Walled city, on high plateau at apex of gulf on the west coast, split by Willowan River… Fabled once an Elven pire of Illefarn, dwarf prospector (Melair) discovered mithril beneath Mt Willow in the first age, struck an agreement to mine… Dwarves (Melairkin Clan) ruled below, elves ruled above. <br> 
	During Godswar, many Elves left to Ellesion. Some elves wanted to stay behind, but sitting emperor didn’t want to see another rule so used magic to raze the city before leaving. Many historians mark this as a threshold of the start of the Crownwars, the mortals arms’ race into the second age. Melairkin Clan dug into undermountian, never seen again…<br> 
	Humans from east ‘discovered’ harbor empty, used as tradeoutpost for most of first age. During which, Halaster Blackcloak built his tower at the base of Mt Willow and ruled until he, like the Melairkin, vanished under the mountain.

Truth of the matter, known by most Undercommon folk and few surface-dwellers:

The Malairkin dug deep, open areas for Drow & Duregar to battle the dwarves, along with Netherese wizards. 
Drow move in, occupy tunnel.
Dwarves protect their home in the Undermountain.
Halaster Blackcloak eventually ousted the dwarves, claims Undermountain as his own
	Some say he was a netherese wizard
	First human ruler of Willow - built towers above Mt Willow
	Summoned 7 fell creatures to build tower, send them into Undermountain to explore & tunnel - chased away Duregar to the east, enslaved many drow/Illithid 
	Slowly builds enormous dungeon
	Pulls creatures from other plane to populate dungeon, protect his secrets & treasure

In early days of Willow, humans knew of the undermountain though would use it as a place of banishment

Skullport
	-Dates back to Nertheril Empire - settled in an area named Skullport Cavern
	-Dwarven city, built by Melairkin in the First Age, sustained through the Godwar
	-Eventually found by Halaster & his planar beasts, he established himself as ruler for a time before disappearing further below, permitting Skullport to exist as a 3rd level of the Undermountain
	-Becomes a prosperous trading post
	-Now, to those who know, is a dangerous hive of thievery, most prominently the base of operations of Xanathar’s Guild

The Xanathar
Beholder, title has been passed down for near 200 years

Many Willowans that have heard stories believe Xanathar is fictional, or if there ever was a real Xanathar he has long since been assassinated or died of old age. The fact that he his a beholder, many believe, are antiquated scare tactics - monster stories - used to ward off would-be vigilantes.

Guild itself is highly secretive, to the point that many consider it a rumor; it’s described as something “whispered in the shadows of Willow”. It’s entirely possible for an ordinary person to doubt the guild’s existence and it’s possible that they have never even heard of it. 
	“I don’t know if the Xanathar really exists, but as long as I’m working in Willow, I make sure he gets a cut.” -Temerin, burglar

Anonymity - the fewer people who know the guild leader is a beholder, the better. Thus it has four lietenants that carry out its daily operations in Willow: Kal’dir, Quid, Sial sapphire, and Draak. On occasion they have masquereaded as the Xanathar, their identities magically protected when undertaking the role.

Typical Beholder paranoia
