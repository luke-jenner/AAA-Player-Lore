At one point the Lattice of Heaven, before the [[Dawnwar & Primordials]]

Made by the [[Gods]]

Floating in the [[Astral Sea]]

Ethereal Plane does not exist here. 

Magic works differently - domains were derived from the weave and once organized, though their fractured nature leaves a lot in flux. Invisibility will likely work, but the amount of powerful beings on the outer planes may render it useless. Sometimes all magic is very visible, sometimes it’s warded off such as at The Spire in The Outlands. Each one is different, and spaces inside of each domain can vary as well. 

- The [[Astral Sea]] is pure space, in-between space, the original Darkness
- The Outer Planes are a circular system of Divine Domains defined by philosophy and morality, separated from the Material Plane by the Divine Gate
	- Separated into Lawful / Conflict / Chaos, as well as Higher (Good) and Lower (Evil)
### Once, The Lattice of Heaven
- Drawn by Gods/Composers/Creators - one grand structure of worlds & planes
- A specific web of connections - the stars - to design and direct the flow of the Ethereal Weave
- A bastion complex in the middle of the Astral Sea - the Pure Darkness
- Chaosether existed in the Darkness and was walled off by the Lattice, protected by Chaos Seals

### Shattered After the Dawnwar
- Destroyed by the Titans, who resented the Gods for claiming dominion over Primordial Chaos
- Fractured, rebuilt by the Gods/Composers into countless planar islands in the Astral Sea
- Some maintained connections and orbital pulls of one another
- Some fractured into one another, creating several layers of one concretion
- Some rebuilt bridges, others built their own walls with specific doors of communion
- After the Godswar, the Divine Gate was constructed to wall off the Material Plane from Direct Contact by the Outer Planes

### Plane Traveling Mechanics
- Charge-up time (not instantaneous) - 1 minute for inner, 10 minutes for outer
- Recharge time 1 day (or 1d4-1 days, modifier contingent)
- Need to find a Conduit, like the Paxis in C1 - planar key can direct towards one
	- Planar Keys are used in Sigil & The Outlands to open portals to other planes
		- For instance, there's a revolving door in a tavern in Sigil called Face of Gith - if you walk through it with melting ice, it'll take you to Limbo
	- Then, if using a Planar Rod can jump, otherwise go to Astral Sea
	- Conduits & Channels are necessary - only a few Divine Domains/Outer Planes are stable in their positioning
- Going to need more hardware - some planes are inhospitable without the right wards on the ship
	- Strongly recommend to not Plane Shift to a plane you're unfamiliar with - 99% chance of death blindly plane-shifting to Plane of Fire.
	- Most planar ships have crewed positions
		- Wardmaster oversees activation of said wards
	- Wards are important, though can be costly
		- Inferno Barrier - Plane of fire - absorbs and disperses extreme heat
			- 10,000gp (Phoenix Feather 5k, Fire Opal 3k, Essence of Fire Elemental 1.5k)
		- Aqua Sheild - Plane of Water - waterproof barrier that repels pressure
			- 8,000gp (Pearl of water breathing 2k, Coral Branch 1.5k, Water Elemental Core 2.5k, Mithral Inlays 2k)
		- Earthen Aegis - Plane of EArth - absorbs impacts from rocks & boulders, protects from dust & debris
			- 9,000gp (Diamond Dust 3k, Ironwood Heart 2k, Earth Elemental Gem 2.5k,, Granite Slabs 1.5k)
		- Tempest Shield - Plane of Air - barrier that neutralizes high speed winds and lightning strikes, other atmospheric dangesr
	- Outer Plane wards sort of counteract their opposite plane
		- Radiant Ward from Mount Celestia repels malevolence of the abyss
			- 12,000 (Celestial Quartz 5k, Angelic feathers 2.5k, Holy Water of Celestia 1.5k, Silver & Gold inlays 1k)

Yggdrasil, the World Tree
	- Roots are pathways between Outer Planes
	- Interdimensional tree
	- Nifleheim (hades) to Pandemonium to Yssgard
	- Also Beastlands, Elysium, Limbo, and Astral Plane/Prime Material Plane

Mount Olympus
	Interplanar Pathway
	Roots reach into Hades, Gahenna, and Carcerai
	Peaks in Arborea, the Astral Plane and the Prime Material Plane (Mount Sinaeus)
	Can be found incaverns on the lower planes or slopes on the higher planes

The River Styx
	Connects Lower Planes: Pandemonium, the Abyss, Carceri, Hades, and Gehenna/Tytherion
	- Headwaters in Pandesmos, in Pandemoinum - usually shallow
	- In Abyss, the Plain of Infinite Portals - the first layer, town of Pazunian of Broken Reach - feeds a moat of Orcus' palace in the  layer of Thanatos
	- In Carceri, mingles with bogs, soaking the ground with magic
	- In Hades, Oinos - banks of Styx are ranging ground for hte Blood War
	- In Gehenna, the greatest river in Khalas, rushing through canyons and gorges and a rapid speed with dangerous waterfalls - incredibly dangerous to sail here
	- In Hells - the first layer of AVernus and the fifth layer of Stygia, a cut channel in a frozen sea
	- In Acheron, Avalas - around different cubes
	- Ends in Acheron at ice of Ocanthus, where "all lost memories are claimed"

### Planar Punk
- Angels and devils are rubbing shoulders, saving the multiverse from ancient evils and faction wars, though still need to make rent by the end of the month
- Thankless multiverse, like Star Wars
- Communities of outcasts and rebels living in floating structures, cobbled together from debris of magical planes (Limbo)
- Underground Clubs on Elysium, hidden in the seren environment - celestial beings gather to discuss philosophy, plan acts of rebellion against oppressive higher ups, and enjoy musical performances blending divine hymns with punk rock
- Communal Workshops of Bytopia, along with skybound farms

## The Outer Planes
### Elysium
"The Blessed Fields" - Neutral Good
Peace, goodness, fertile richness, natural beauty
Pelor & Ioun, Eldath
Four Layers:
	- Amoria: Woodland and Meadow, HQ of Transcendent Order
	- Eronia: Mountainous, where River Oceanus tumbles into waterfalls
		- Location of the Precipice of Vaa'Baen
	- Belierin: Pleasant marsh, free of disease (and annooying insects)
	- Thalasia: Great River Oceanus source (connects Elysium, Beastlands, & Arborea)
		- Sea dotted with islands and filled with sea gods
		- Likely broken from the Elemental Plane of Water

#### Adventures in Elysium
- The [Guardinals](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Guardinal) are to the layer Amoria from Hades, using Yggdrasil as their way of travel. A number of the beings they rescued are being controlled/manipulated to provide information to Yugoloths of their path they are taking to reach the Upper Planes. It isn't certain who is the spy, so the party must travel through the seas of Oceanus, climb down Yggdrasil to deal with these spies, who are being protected by the Guardinals as victims.
    
- Negotiations with the Kenku of [Blackfeather Barren](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Belierin) are underway, with the potential removal of their curse being the only thing that will prevent them from doing their invasion. Aaracokra have left for Precipe, a place in the layer of Eronia where they might talk to their god who might help in the removal of this ancient curse. Due to their Overwhelming Joy (DMG p60) of the plane, they haven't returned.
    
- I don't need to go into detail with [Belierin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Belierin) as its very easy to set up for an adventure or campaign. An ancient legendary hydra, an archfiend, and many more powerful non-good beings residing in this layer makes this a goldmine to use, if they add more lore to this eventually.
    
- In order to retrieve the unknown heroes of the Prime Material Plane residing in the layer [Thalasia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Belierin), some conditions must be met. The party must travel the islands dotting this layer to find the hidden stories of these heroes, and replicate them. Luckily/unluckily, their intent is creating beings that will allow them to do this, although they are also haunting the seas of this plane at the same time.
### Bytopia
-"Twin Paradises" - Neutral-Lawful Good
Industrious, honest work, peace
Garl Glittergold (chief diety of gnomish pantheon), Ilmater
Forests, meadows, streams
Two layers on top of one another, (sky is the other layer), connected by great mountain columns
Gravity reverses once you reach the halfway point
- Dothion: Forests & fields, hunters, farmers, fisherman, traders, gnomes
- Shurrock: Mountains, mining, smelting, crafting
#### Adventures in Bytopia
- A large number of dead Gnomes reside within this layer of [Dothion](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dothion) and all of them mean well. Their inventions don't all the time, and the lack of locks for their junkyard has resulted in one of the sentient animals awakening a number of these inventions. The party must enter this place in order to cut the source of power.
    
- The harsh storms of the layer [Shurrock](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shurrock) are very dangerous, and can obscure whole areas for days. On one of these storms, [Renbuu](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rennbuu), one of the Slaad Lords, has changed the colour of Mercillia, a platinum dragon watching over the layer. With new changes to her personality, the party must travel to find this Slaad in this horrible weather, before the dragon is forced out of the plane by the many guardians residing within, or her own actions damn her.
    
- If you use the Persuasive Goodwill optional rule (DMG p59) for this plane, multiple evil creatures might be brought to this plane to change them for the better. A number of them might attempt to fight their way out of this plane, or an incredibly powerful originally evil mage might've just gotten Dispel Evil And Good casted on them, dispelling the effect of the plane on them.
### Mount Celestia
Seven Heavens - Bahamut, Kord, & Moradin
Plane of Lawful Good
Game of Mountains and the Foothills, set amidst an endless ocean
Layers are formed of higehr and higher mountains
- 1- [[Lunia]] - The Silver Heaven - Eternal summer's night
- 2- Mercuria - The Golden Heaven - golden light, where angels train for battle

	- Sky is color of multitude of glittering gems
	- Atop peak is a ziggurat that leads to seventh layer

	- So few given access that descriptions are shrouded in mystery
	- Burns out all indifference in evil
	- Saild to merge souls into the essence of the plane, losing indivdual selves to the glory of all
	Three tallest mountains, known as the throne peaks - shaped by deities at will
	Gray waters surround the Foothills - shimmering gold veil surrounds the dominion - piercing the veil
	Foothills - verdant forests & lush meadows - fragrance of wildflowers, pleasant & mild temperature 
#### Adventures in Mount Celestia
- The huge number of tombs for holy Fighters and Paladins within the layer [Mercuria](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mercuria) are ripe for the picking! The Celestials likely won't appreciate this, even the things within are needed to defeat a "minor" evil in their eyes.
    
- The armies of heaven are marshalling in Mercuria to fight a great battle against one of the Lower Planes. If they fight at full force, they won't retreat and might be wiped out. So your group is sent to damage or weaken this holy army to either delay the battle or to make sure they will retreat knowing their weakened state.
    
- Travelling to the Glass Tarn, a lake in the layer [Venya](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Venya) that supposedly provides visions or prophecies to visitors, the party find themselves stuck in a vision of the future that they will need to escape.
    
- Intent on removing the source of power of the BBEG Paladin, the party travels to the Militant within the layer [Solania](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Solania), to find the highly guarded and secret source of power for Paladins.
    
- Many visitors to Solania feel compelled to leave behind their material possessions due to the influence of [Pistis Sophia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pistis_Sophia) ruler of this realm. One of the recent visitors of this place was a holy Monk who left behind an artifact of great power, which can be of great help in the current trying times.
    
- Rampha, a city with odd temporal distortions in the layer [Mertion](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mertion) is being invaded by a Fallen Celestial with the belief he might be capable of changing his actions if he entered one of these portals. Though he may succeed, if he fails, the consequences would be horrendous, so it might be better to prevent him from entering in the first place.
    
- Empyrea's magical healing waters are being perverted into something harmful. Search Mertion for the source of this contamination in order to clear the waters, and to gain a phial of these waters to bring back to the Prime Material to heal an NPC.
    
- The characters managed to enter the layer [Jovar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jovar) with the intent of entering the last layer. The being barring them entry is [Sealtiel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sealtiel), the ruler who prevents the schemes of fiends. This is especially unfortunate, due to your souls potentially being damned by the deal you made with a Rakshasa unless you succeed in getting past him.
    
- A truly holy mortal has succeeded in entering the divine layer of [Chronias](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chronias), which will soon result in him becoming a part of the very plane itself. Not wishing for this to be the end of them, the party has begun the journey to recover them before they are consumed, the issue is that none of them are pure good, so a different way of entry is required (otherwise they might be disintegrated entering).
### Arcadia
-"Land of Perfect Order"
-Lawful Neutral-Good
Woodlands, harmonious kingdoms
	Grown in orchards
	Towns laid out in neat squares
Tallest peak is Orb of Night and DAy

Originally 3 layers, until one merged with Mechanus as its philosophy moved more towards Order & Law
	- Abellio - Mostly flat, ordered kingdoms
	- Buxenus - Militaristic, sometimes cult-like fanatics
	- Nemausus - now a cog in Mechanus

#### Adventures in Arcadia:
- Numerous Dwarves can found underneath the mountains. The party might venture to this plan in order to find a smith that has long died in the Prime Material, as he can make something for them. He might be in [Mount Clangeddin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Clangeddin), and due to a recent fight occurring with the Devils, the major passages into the city are blocked, resulting in the party climbing the tall and stormy mountain.
- The Storm Kings rule the weather on this plane, and odd patterns occurring might be the result of some battle going on or has ended.
- [Formians](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Formian) long ago descended to Mechanus from Arcadia due to their increasing Lawfulness and lack of Good nature. They intend to invade Arcadia in order to have their layer region Arcadia.
- The trading city of the Mandible, residing on the layer [Abellio](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abellio) has managed to gain a great deal of wealth in a recent trade they made. Other Planar beings have turned their eye towards the city, with the intent to trade, steal, trick, or straight-up destroy the place for their wealth.
- Harmonium (an organization that is the embodiment of Lawful Stupid) has begun yet another campaign to convert Chaotic beings into orderly ones forcefully within the layer [Buxenus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Buxenus). A series of kidnapping for conscription into their holy army needs to end after a few notable NPCs are taken from their home.

	-If any modron dies, the neearest modron from the next lowest cast gets automatically promoted to take its place
	-Monodrones will create new monodrones by Mechanical Mitosis
-Ruler of Modrons is Primus - the One and the Prime
-Fraternity of Order - HQ called Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment

### Acheron
-"The Infernal Battlefield" - Lawful Neutral-Evil
- Constant pointless war, identity is forever lost
- Conformity is better than good (often causes pointless cruelty and suppression)
- Plane of blocks the size of cities and kingdoms, drifting endlessly through space
- Petitioners here are often warriors lost to the joy of battle, or saviors that forgot their cause
- Four Layers:
	- Avalas - The Battlefields & The Factories

Tiamat’s Vacant Lair & Dominion of Zehir 
	Servants of Tiamat & Zehir (serpent god) skirmish frequently, but th e serpent keeps to crags - 
	After Dawnwar, Tiamat sieged Tytherion believing Zehir could be overthrown - misjudged 
	Tiamat’s Realm: Azharul - mostly underground realm of dragons
	Archipleago: The Scales 
	composed of mountains and smoky, burning volcanoes with no bases or peaks—everything was built onto or carved into the sides of these mountains and gravity was at a 45° angle with the ground. Deeper layers had less heat and volcanic activity until you got to Krangath which had no natural light or heat

### Hades/Gray Wastes

- Mostly dull-gray on top layer
- Pluton, lowest layer, is Hades
- Most of the bloodshed of the Blood War
- Oinos: Gray, battleground for blood war
- Niflheim: Thick mists, home to Hel
- Pluton: Blackened dying trees, ruled over by Hades 
The three layers of Hades were Oinos, Niflheim, and Pluton. Pluton is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Hades. The layers of Hades were called _glooms_ for good reason; they were realms devoid of emotion, hope, and peace—grey land and grey sky throughout, with no sun, moon, or seasons to break the monotony.
	Here [Anthraxus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anthraxus "Anthraxus") ruled in his mighty fortress, the [Khin-Oin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Khin-Oin "Khin-Oin").

Leira, Talos

Chaotic Neutral - Ever-shifting chaos, anarchist
Where the [[Horizon Guard]] believes is best to research Chaosether

- Some say it has Layers, some say it doesn't
	- Five layers, named after its inhabitants:
		- Gith/Slaad - where Githyanki have a city and villages
		- Susanoo
		- Agni
		- Indra
		- Layer of Lost Gods
	- Disagreement largely due to all layers looking the same

#### Adventures in Limbo
- **Objective**: A powerful elemental storm threatens to destroy a community in Limbo. The party must find a way to stabilize the chaotic energies and save the inhabitants.
- **Challenges**: Navigating the ever-changing landscape of Limbo, negotiating with volatile elemental beings, and devising a way to channel the storm’s energy safely.

Marthammor Duin's Cavern of Rest in Nidavellir

#### Adventures in Ysgard

- If you use the optional rule Immortal Wrath (DMG p61), you can use it to set up interesting events. An outsider might be intent on figuring out how nearly all creatures can come back to life within this place, potentially as a better route than becoming a lich. A great tournament might occur in or near a portal to Ysgard, allowing those killed to return to life without any problems. Maybe there is a being permanently killing creatures there by turning the denizens into Undead, and the party is sent to discover who it is, all the while the normal wars are being waged.
    
- The Norse pantheon are found here, so you might be able to take inspiration from the stories.
    
- The plane is overall more hostile with the number of different creatures residing there, so fighting Giants, Dragons, or other creatures wouldn't be weird
    
- [Muspelheim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Muspelheim), a layer filled with magma and molten rock, is home to the Fire Giants. Portals to the Plane of Fire are somewhat common here, and secret negotiations between the Fire Giants and the [City of Brass](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/City_of_Brass) are underway. The party is sent to stop these talks, before an alliance between Efreeti, Devils, and Fire Giants can occur.
### Arborea/Arvandor/Olympus

	- Peliori - white stone, ruins

#### Adventures in Arborea
- This plane has 3 major factions, the Greek Gods (whose stories are inspiring enough), the Seladrine (the Elvish Pantheon, which might be constantly fighting against the Dark Seladrine), and the Seelie Courts, which might appear within the area from time to time. These three together make an interesting area with varying views.
    
- The layer Aquallar is a huge sea that has connections to the Plane of Water, so Marids attempting to create their own little kingdom in the area wouldn't be unheard of.
    
- The layer Mithardir is an interesting place, being a white desert covered in ancient ruins that no one knows comes from. It might be useful to set up a great evil that your BBEG has done, the remnants of an ancient civilization might reside with the last bits of forbidden lore, or the party might've found themselves stuck here, and now must survive this wasteland until they find a portal elsewhere.
### The Beastlands
-"Happy hunting grounds" - Neutral-Chaotic good
-No cities/settelments, only wild animals
-Lush & savage
Three Layers:
	Krigala: Always noon, river Oceanus
	Brux: Twilight, cool and misty
	Karasuthra: nocturnal animals

#### Adventures in the Beastlands
- In order to weather the freezing winds of the Plane of Ice, magical hides need to be collected, and they can be gained in great numbers in this plane. Whether the Beast Lords or the sentient magical animals residing here will let you is unlikely. The possibility of transforming into the animal killed here make things even more complicated (DMG p60).
    
- The Library of All Knowledge residing in [Brux](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brux) holds a lot of useful info and forbidden lore, stuff many beings are trying to get at any costs. Numerous seiges have been occurring there as of late, and discovery of who are laying them is vital, as well as what they want to know.
    
- The wise words mortai, sentient clouds, are needed. They seemingly are trying to avoid conversing with the group, maybe due to the meat they had earlier for lunch. Climbing the large trees, dealing with the flying animals, or conversing with wind spirits is needed to reach them.
### The Outlands
Sigil
- Massive Disc around The Spire, with 16 Gate Towns
- "Plane of Concordant Opposition" - compelte independence, True Neutral
- Layers are 10 concentric rings
	- Magic works less and less as you get closer to the center
	- 9th: mostly unaffected
	- 8th: 9th level spells don't work
	- 7th: 8th level spells don't work
	- 6th: and so-on
	- ...The Spire: No spells work
- Gate towns leads to other planes, some very influenced by their respective planes 
- Sigil magic works just fine aside from planar travel spells
